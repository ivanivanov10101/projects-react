		h1: 'Ciao, Venezia! European correspondent George Fenwick hits the Lido to report on the Letterboxd community’s reactions to the 80th Venice Film Festival’s most primo premieres.',
		content: 'Sex, fast cars and hitmen brought exhilarating highs and Aggro Dr1fts to the first weekend of the 80th Venice Film Festival. The most thrilling moment for me wasn’t in a film at all: it was when I was crossing the lagoon back to San Marco on the vaporetto, lulled into a dreamlike peace after Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s Evil Does Not Exist, and our boat thwumped into the wake of another.\n' +

			'Through the window I’d cranked open to let in some air instead came the ocean, and myself and the poor man behind me were suddenly drenched in seawater I presume hadn’t been clean for several centuries.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'I mopped myself with Kleenex and smiled. Everything is a metaphor when you watch movies. It was not ideal to be dripping wet on a ferry in front of dozens of other journalists, but something about this first weekend at Venice felt slightly askew from the beginning anyway. We’re here to celebrate great cinema, but with numerous absences at red carpets and press conferences due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike actions, we’re doing so with an acute awareness of the power imbalances and inequalities that run through the industry.'

		alt: 'Kiah McKirnan stars as Jonny in Perpetrator.',
		h1: 'Upon the release of her latest horror venture, Perpetrator writer-director Jennifer Reeder chats fake-blood-making techniques, embracing monstrous femmes and casting Alicia Silverstone as the ultimate matriarch.',
		content: 'In the world of Jennifer Reeder’s feminist genre films, dead girls sing, blood has agency and teenagers get more than car keys on their birthday. Take Jonquil ‘Jonny’ Baptiste (Kiah McKirnan), the rebellious mixed-race high schooler who leads Reeder’s latest, Perpetrator. On Jonny’s eighteenth birthday, her father sends her to live with her great-aunt Hildie (Alicia Silverstone), who reveals Jonny’s secret inheritance: a power, passed down through the women in the family, to take on the form of other people through a sort of turbo-charged empathy. This will come in handy, as Jonny and her girlfriend Aviva (Casimere Jollette) use it to track down a serial killer behind a slew of disappearances of young women.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'Framing empathy as a superpower rather than a weakness is typical of Reeder’s radical approach to genre material, as the writer-director explores monstrous femininity and the ways we create and re-create ourselves every day. Reeder’s 2019 film Knives and Skin explored America’s obsession with missing girls through a trio of female high-school friends, told in a dissociative style that Reeder describes as “hovering above reality.” Perpetrator operates on an unearthly register as well, drawing from chilly Hitchcockian suspense and outrageous body horror to create a lightly surreal deadpan noir that’s just a couple degrees off from everyday life.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'Letterboxd sat down with Reeder in her hometown of Chicago on a sunny Wednesday afternoon in August, as she looked back at the chilly, muddy production of the film and shared her unabashedly feminine, deeply personal—and often very bloody—approach to filmmaking.'

It’s all kicked off with the 2023 Venice Film Festival and its Venice Classics sidebar, whose diverse crop includes a tribute to Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida and a reconstruction of the complete, pre-censorship version of Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev, as well as low-brow delights from Ruggero Deodato and my personal favorite, Stephanie Rothman.\n' +

			'Hot on that fest’s heels, Toronto is making an event out of the world premiere of a new 4K of Jonathan Demme’s celebrated Talking Heads concert extravaganza, Stop Making Sense. With a whopping 4.6-out-of-five average rating, it’s long been in the top-rated anythings around here. Nothing to stress about if you can’t get to TIFF: the film will simulcast in IMAX around the world; for tickets and showtimes for satellite events, this must be the place.\n' +

		alt: 'Sunny Sandler stars as Stacy Friedman in You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah.',
		content: 'If you left the Uncut Gems party feeling pretty stressed, Sammi Cohen is here for you. The Jewish filmmaker found a spiritual partner in Adam Sandler, for whom they direct his latest Happy Madison venture, in which the star’s movie family is actually composed of the exact same people as his biological family: that’s his wife Jackie, and his daughters Sadie and Sunny, now in the spotlight and all over your Letterboxd reviews about the joint credit block. The result is You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah, a movie that welcomes us with open arms.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'“No one understands the value of tweenage girldom like Adam Sandler,” Letterboxd member Calseyyy writes. Sandler has been casting his daughters in his films for well over a decade (and allegedly, hilariously having them write his awards speeches), but in Bat Mitvah, they finally take the lead. Sadie plays older sister Ronnie Friedman to Sunny’s Stacy Friedman, who is a soon-to-be thirteen-year-old planning her bat mitzvah, like every good Jewish girl must.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'It is the moment she becomes a woman, the party everyone will have eyes on, so everything has to be perfect. It’s what she and her best friend Lydia (Samantha Lorraine) have been planning since the day they were born. Of course, drama ensues (Sandler in this movie is, once more, married to Idina Menzel—Cohen is ready for the Uncut Gems fancams) because nothing more perfectly represents the world-shattering anxiety of adolescence than a bat mitzvah.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'But also a bar mitzvah, or a b’nai mitzvah or b’mitzvah, celebrations in the Jewish faith that welcome you into adulthood whatever your gender expression—a testament to Cohen’s beautifully progressive worldview and filmmaking, a beacon of light to young Jewish people who might really need to see this right now. Plus: Olivia Rodrigo vibes, Eighth Grade anxiety, sweaty running girls, ‘Sweet Caroline’ and all the greatest things of the most stressful soirees of your life. Sammi Cohen is throwing a party, and tells us all about it below.\n' +

		image: '/assets/news_images/news_5.jpg',
		h1: 'Mitchell Beaupre dives into the world of tags, which can help you spice up your Letterboxd life, save money, discover new ﬁlm friends and get deeply nostalgic.',
		content: 'A few years into my relationship with Samm, we got into a (friendly, innocent) disagreement over how many films we had watched together. They insisted that it couldn’t possibly be more than a hundred, while I was sure it was well over two hundred. Thankfully, I had been keeping tabs: in my Letterboxd logs, I’d used a tag— with samm —for every single one, and it took mere seconds to check the facts and reveal the truth.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'Who was right? That’s not important. (Me, it was me. I was right.) What does matter is that this was simply one instance of Letterboxd tags proving invaluable.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'Whether it’s winning an argument with a loved one or something far more practical, tags can improve your life (and save you money, more on that soon). Like Letterboxd itself, how you use tags is entirely up to you. Tracking who I was watching movies with started as a Samm-exclusive thing, but after a recent Journal feature about our mothers’ favorite films, I was inspired to go back through my decade of diary entries and beef up those tags to include other film-watching buddies.'

		h1: 'Letterboxd correspondents sift through the prestige pictures (Michael Mann!) and indie gems (Kitty Green!) coming to the Venice, Toronto, London and New York Film Festivals to present our most-anticipated of the upcoming festival season.',
		content: 'It’s the most wonderful time of the year: fall festival season! The cinema floodgates officially open with Venice International Film Festival on August 30, with the deluge continuing into Toronto, Austin’s Fantastic Fest, New York, London and Tokyo throughout September and October. Our nimble team of correspondents will be on the ground at all of these fests—and more! Telluride traditionally withholds its lineup until opening day; Tokyo has yet to announce its stash—where we will be gathering high-quality fodder for best-of lists and gauging the Letterboxd community’s first reactions.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'This autumn, however, things look a little different. For one, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes are in effect, meaning many actors likely won’t be in attendance (although there are exceptions). For another, there’s no clear frontrunner: this time last year, Everything Everywhere All at Once was the juggernaut underdog barreling towards assured awards season victory (the final tally higher than anyone on that team could have dreamed). \n' +
			'\n' +
			'Nevertheless, the festival lineups are stacked with auteurs and stars (including Chris Pine’s directorial debut, Poolman, and Richard Linklater’s latest collaboration with Glen Powell, Hit Man), and that’s not even to mention the hidden gems waiting to be unearthed by cinephiles around the world.'

		content: 'Scroll the comments on any of our social posts about Kamila Andini and you’ll find “mother” compliments aplenty. The Indonesian filmmaker, whose 2021 coming-of-age feature, Yuni, was named the third highest-rated in our Year in Review, has been a pivotal figure in contemporary Indonesia cinema for the past decade. In a region where horror is the often best indicator of box office success—many Letterboxd lists are devoted to ranking the films of scaremongers Joko Anwar, the Mo Brothers and friends—Anidini, her father Garin Nugroho, husband Ifa Isfansyah and their FourColours Films colleagues are nurturing a different cast of independent voices. \n' +
			'\n' +
			'Andini’s own particular means of expression is to tell stories of Indonesian women and their struggles for self-determination against the republic’s Islamist backdrop. Child marriage, gender violence, political representation, the rights of people to love who they love: the issues are broad and critical on a human rights level, but Andini tends to zero in on a single household, layering a lush, illusive atmosphere over day-to-day domesticity.

		h1: 'Scrapper writer-director Charlotte Regan and star Harris Dickinson talk working-class stories, soccer shirts, unfair comparisons and Letterboxd hype.',
		content: 'Charlotte Regan’s favorite Letterboxd review of Scrapper, which I won’t link here, calls her “the worst of the two Charlottes,” crowning Aftersun director Charlotte Wells the winner of this non-existent battle. Regan loves that film, so is “backing” Wells in the fake fight and suggests both filmmakers read bad reviews of their films to one another. “It would be such a sick time,” she says.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'Scrapper and Aftersun are wildly different films, but are made by British women and feature a father and daughter, so I guess it’s easy, if lazy, to join the dots. But the whole thing about Aftersun, about Scrapper, about Blue Jean, Rye Lane, Sweetheart and so many other recent films from the British Isles, is that all of these storytellers bring different experiences, sensitivities, talents and loves to their art.\n' +

Not content with releasing Magic Mike’s Last Dance and the noir series Full Circle this year, Steven Soderbergh recently dropped yet another surprise on fans. Clocking in at eight short episodes, Command Z adds up to a bingeable, feature-length fable soaked in wormhole juice and comes with an ear-worm thanks to ‘The Theme from Mahogany’.

Currently the 52nd highest-rated film of all-time on Letterboxd, the film earned director Park Chan-wook (Decision to Leave, The Handmaiden) the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and helped cement the filmmaker’s renown in overseas territories. It has also largely been credited as being responsible for kicking off the international success of the Korean New Wave, which would see fellow filmmakers including Bong Joon-ho, Lee Chang-dong and Kim Jee-woon increasing in popularity.\n' +
			'\n' +
			'Loosely adapted by Park and co-writers Hwang Jo-yun and Lim Jun-hyung from a manga of the same name, Oldboy has been a stalwart of many “you’ve gotta see this movie, it’s so messed up” conversations from dorm rooms to internet message boards over the past two decades. The story puts us directly into the mysterious circumstances of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a seemingly ordinary man who one day is abducted and imprisoned for fifteen years. With no explanation as to where he is or why he’s been held captive, Oh Dae-su is just as bizarrely released back into the world seemingly at random. His mission is three-fold: figure out who locked him up, discover why they locked him up and then get his bloody revenge.'
